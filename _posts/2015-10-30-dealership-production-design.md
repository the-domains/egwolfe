# Dealership Production Design

Last night we transformed one end of the dealership to celebrate momentum. Red, silver, and white branding is maintained for this main event stage and the rest of the dealership.

VIPs are enjoying catered small plates. The president and others just completed their speeches. Guests are about to experiment the main event. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/338e8905-6642-4288-ae76-15a326957569.jpg)

Pre-show look. Lights are slowly strafing across the ceiling above the "stage" that we made. Truss warmers are twinkling white on the silver sticks of vertical truss and anticipation is in the air (or is that haze?) ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6dbb6a3e-f6ea-45e7-bf28-a258204e0049.jpg)

I prepared myself in position at lighting control (my Jands Vista S1 - I and/or my console are available for hire/rent) back stage. I transitioned the lights as the intro video played and encouraged the talent to break a leg...
Actually, I took this shot well after the event just before we tore down - through the veil of the CrushedBlack fabric, you can see the car already on stage - in the moment I was too busy firing off a barrage of lighting effects; as well as cuing dancers, actors, and a driver for their moments of the production.
I'm really bummed not to have any photos to share of the live number we performed. Hopefully I can get some shots or video from one of the guests. I wish I had thought to set up a GoPro or few to record. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f0767a22-52bb-4bf5-a6d8-148aec44d969.jpg)

After the event, I hurried to offer photography to guests as they all wanted to pose with the cast. I managed even to get a \#castandcrew shot taken of me (in the coveralls that was part of the branding) with the performers. These guys are great, by the way. If you're looking for actors and/or dancers (and/or hamsters?) contact me and I can refer you to some great Metro Detroit talent. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/add252cc-55bf-41d8-bbdd-6e5fd7efd8c8.jpg)

One of my other responsibilities was to take photos of the president and leadership holding their awards at the corporate stage for earlier speeches at far end of the room. This is my view walking back toward the main stage. I share it to give context of the space. Even at the end of the night, the mood still feels good in the transformed dealership.
Interesting to contemplate that two hours later, everything is packed up and the morning crew will be able to bring cars back into the space for normal operations. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/14030284-90c9-43c0-9ac2-1a2aa5de162b.jpg)

I think this image is hilarious; this pair of hamsters remained at the ready long after every guest had taken photos and the catering had been cleared. 

It was a fun event. It always is when a producer tells me they want to drive a car on stage!
