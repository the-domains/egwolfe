# A beautiful foggy November morning in Michigan

I woke up the other morning as the sun was rising to greet beautiful fog covering our backyard. I didn't have the proper time for a photoshoot, but did grab my camera to snap a couple images from my window. Then after dropping off my youngest son at his school, I stopped at the park to breath in the glorious morning air.

I was quite bummed that responsibilities kept me from setting up for a proper photo shoot. Instead of simply shooting out my window, I would've loved to grab my camera and head over to the cemetery or the lake. I missed the best photographic opportunities during the time spent getting ready for school and work. Even still, I was grateful to look out the windows (of the house and then car) to take in the beauty with my eyes.
